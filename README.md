# Reinforcement-Learning
ML Project to demonstrate the concept of Reinforcement Learning

Robots in a Warehouse

The Robot or Agent must start from starting point and travel through the warehouse to reach the detination point by using a shortest path.
This problem is solved using the concept of Q-Learning which is a Reinforcement Learning algorithm
